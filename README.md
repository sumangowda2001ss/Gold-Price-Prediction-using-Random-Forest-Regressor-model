# Gold-Price-Prediction-using-Random-Forest-Regressor-model

The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest Regression, for predicting gold prices based on various economic indicators. The trained model achieves high accuracy, as indicated by the R-squared score, and the predictions are visualized to provide insights into the model's performance.

This project can be further extended by experimenting with different machine learning algorithms, feature engineering techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and incorporating additional data sources for improving prediction accuracy.
